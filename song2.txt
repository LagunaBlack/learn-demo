Time, it needs time
To win back your love again
I will be there, I will be there
Love, only love
Can bring back your love someday
I will be there, I will be there

I'm still loving you
I'm still loving you

I'll fight, baby, I'll fight
To win back your love again
I will be there, I will be there
Love, only love
Can bring down the wall someday
I will be there, I will be there

If we'd go again
All the way from the start
I would try to change
The things that killed our love
